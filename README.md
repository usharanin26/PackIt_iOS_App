# PackIt_iOS_App

App Name:
PackIt
Introduction:
It is an app to help people organize their packing list for their holidays. In general, people often forget some or the other essential item to carry with them on a vacation.  This app will help people with this problem. Whether you are packing for a ten-day holiday or a weekend trip, this app provides all the things that you might need to pack for your vacation. PackIt helps you figure out the items you need to pack so that you won’t forget them in a hurry before your travel. 

Specifications:
PackIt filters the items to pack based on the weather, number of days of travel, mode of transport, etc. You can delete certain items from the list if you don’t feel like you need them. You can delete the list once you have packed everything. Based on the activities that the user selects, we’ll display multiple categories of items to be packed so that the organization gets easier.

Supported activities of this packing list app are:
•	Essentials
•	Music
•	Dancing
•	Golfing
•	Cycling
•	Skiing
Supported Transportation:
•	Flight
•	Car
•	Public Transport

Supported Weather Conditions:
•	Sunny
•	Cold
•	Rainy
Novelty:
Most of the packing list generator apps out in the market don’t give a proper print of the items that are selected. In this implementation, I am trying to display the selected items concisely and clearly. 
Design Justification:
I am using Market Felt Wide font for the title and System font other elements in the app. A dark green background is chosen for the background and the screen consists of the three basic colors. i.e., dark green, orange and white. Not many colors are chosen to make the readability easier. These colors are chosen from colorhunt. The splash screen and app icon are customer made to represent travel. 

Design Pattern:
I would like to use MVC design pattern for this app implementation.

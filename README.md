# PackIt_iOS_App

App Name: PackIt


Introduction:
It is an app to help people organize their packing list for their holidays. In general, people often forget some or the other essential item to carry with them on a vacation.  This app will help people with this problem. Whether you are packing for a ten-day holiday or a weekend trip, this app provides all the things that you might need to pack for your vacation. PackIt helps you figure out the items you need to pack so that you won’t forget them in a hurry before your travel. 


Specifications:
PackIt filters the items to pack based on the weather, number of days of travel, mode of transport, etc. You can delete certain items from the list if you don’t feel like you need them. You can delete the list once you have packed everything. Based on the activities that the user selects, we’ll display multiple categories of items to be packed so that the organization gets easier.


Supported activities of this packing list app are:
•	Essentials
•	Music

Design Pattern:
